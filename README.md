# Gender-Recognition-via-transfer-Learning

Gender Detection with Transfer Learning
This project explores gender detection using transfer learning with various pre-trained models on the CelebA dataset.

Technologies and Dependencies
TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch - choose one for initial implementation)
OpenCV (for image processing)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Additional dependencies might be required based on the chosen framework (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).

Installation
Install Python (if not already installed).
Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies.
Install required libraries using pip:
TensorFlow/Keras:
Bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy
Use code with caution.

Usage
Note: These instructions assume using TensorFlow/Keras for initial implementation. If using PyTorch, refer to separate documentation for specific functionalities.

Download the CelebA dataset from https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.
Pre-process the data (resize images, normalize pixel values).
Choose a pre-trained model (VGGFace2, ResNet50, InceptionV3). Download the corresponding pre-trained weights.
Train the model using the prepared CelebA dataset and a chosen optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
For detailed implementation steps and training scripts, refer to the provided notebooks (gender_detection_keras.ipynb or gender_detection_pytorch.ipynb).

Dataset Information
The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with various facial attributes, including gender labels.

Model Architecture
The project utilizes transfer learning. Pre-trained models (VGGFace2, ResNet50, InceptionV3) are loaded with their weights frozen. New classification layers are added on top for gender prediction.

Evaluation and Results
The model's performance will be evaluated on a validation set using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). Results will be reported in the corresponding notebooks.
